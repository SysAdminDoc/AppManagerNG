# Autonomous Loop State

Last updated: 2026-06-06
Assigned project: `C:\Users\--\repos\AppManagerNG`
Current branch: `main`

## Latest Cycle

- Result: completed Cycle 110 source-audit closure for backup metadata
  APK-filename hardening.
- Updated: `ROADMAP.md`, `COMPLETED.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` now record the
  backup metadata APK-filename hardening and its verification target.
- Code: backup metadata loading now rejects unsafe persisted `apk_name` and
  `split_configs` filenames before restore creates package-staging files from
  them.
- Verification: passed
  `:app:compileFullDebugJavaWithJavac :app:testFullDebugUnitTest --tests io.github.muntashirakon.AppManager.backup.BackupItemsTest`;
  `rtk git diff --check`; and prohibited tool/attribution diff scan.
- Environment note: the ignored local `local.properties` still points at
  `C:\Users\--\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk` so Gradle can use the installed SDK on
  this host. Do not commit `local.properties`.

## Next Cycle

- Continue this same assigned project.
- Next roadmap target: find or promote the next host-verifiable source-backed
  audit slice, since the remaining visible rows are largely device/manual,
  external-submission, or owner-signoff gated.
- Start by scanning backup/profile/settings parser edges, persisted export
  formats, source TODOs, and existing guardrail tests for a small source-backed
  risk that can be tightened without device-only claims.
- Verification target: focused JVM/static tests for any source change, Java
  compile for touched app code, docs/state update, and `rtk git diff --check`.
- Parked follow-ups: device-only Running Apps restore walkthrough, manual
  Android assist invocation, real tag-run attestation verification,
  foreground tracker overlay device walkthroughs, distribution submissions, and
  Android 17 target-SDK gate.
