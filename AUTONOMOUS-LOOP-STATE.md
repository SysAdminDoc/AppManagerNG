# Autonomous Loop State

Last updated: 2026-06-06
Assigned project: `C:\Users\--\repos\AppManagerNG`
Current branch: `main`

## Latest Cycle

- Result: completed Cycle 54 source-FIXME closure for split APK chooser type
  tracking.
- Updated: `ROADMAP.md`, `COMPLETED.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` now record the
  split APK chooser type-tracking fix and its verification target.
- Code: `SplitApkChooser` now routes restored, required, automatic dependency,
  and manual selections through one recorder that stores both selected split ids
  and their type buckets.
- Verification: passed
  `:app:compileFullDebugJavaWithJavac :app:testFullDebugUnitTest --tests io.github.muntashirakon.AppManager.apk.splitapk.SplitApkChooserTest`;
  `rtk git diff --check`; and prohibited tool/attribution diff scan.
- Environment note: the ignored local `local.properties` still points at
  `C:\Users\--\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk` so Gradle can use the installed SDK on
  this host. Do not commit `local.properties`.

## Next Cycle

- Continue this same assigned project.
- Next roadmap target: find or promote the next host-verifiable source-backed
  audit slice, since the remaining visible rows are largely device/manual,
  external-submission, or owner-signoff gated.
- Start by scanning `RESEARCH_REPORT.md`, `docs/audits/`, recent source TODOs,
  and existing guardrail tests for a small source-backed risk that can be
  tightened without device-only claims.
- Verification target: focused JVM/static tests for any source change, Java
  compile for touched app code, docs/state update, and `rtk git diff --check`.
- Parked follow-ups: device-only Running Apps restore walkthrough, manual
  Android assist invocation, real tag-run attestation verification,
  foreground tracker overlay device walkthroughs, distribution submissions, and
  Android 17 target-SDK gate.
