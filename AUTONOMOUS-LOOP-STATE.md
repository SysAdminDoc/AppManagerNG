# Autonomous Loop State

Last updated: 2026-06-07
Assigned project: `C:\Users\--\repos\AppManagerNG`
Current branch: `main`

## Latest Cycle

- Result: completed Cycle 218 source-audit closure for hex viewer
  validation-toast hardening.
- Updated: `ROADMAP.md`, `COMPLETED.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` now record the
  hex viewer validation-toast hardening and its verification target.
- Code: Hex viewer offset and search validation toasts now use the shared hex
  viewer error-message formatter before rendering exception messages, sharing
  the same control-flattening, formula-prefix defusing, and class-name fallback
  behavior as open/read errors.
- Verification: passed
  `:app:compileFullDebugJavaWithJavac :app:testFullDebugUnitTest --tests io.github.muntashirakon.AppManager.fm.hex.HexViewerActivityTest --tests io.github.muntashirakon.AppManager.fm.hex.HexViewerUtilsTest`;
  `rtk git diff --check`; and prohibited tool/attribution diff scan.
- Environment note: the ignored local `local.properties` still points at
  `C:\Users\--\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk` so Gradle can use the installed SDK on
  this host. Do not commit `local.properties`.

## Next Cycle

- Continue this same assigned project.
- Next roadmap target: continue auditing one-off share builders and chooser
  metadata for host-verifiable URI-grant and metadata defects.
- Rescan remaining share, chooser, and clipboard metadata paths for any
  host-verifiable subject, URI, MIME, or empty-body gaps; if this cluster is
  exhausted, switch to the next source-audit cluster.
- Verification target: focused JVM/static tests for any source change, Java
  compile for touched app code, docs/state update, and `rtk git diff --check`.
- Parked follow-ups: device-only Running Apps restore walkthrough, manual
  Android assist invocation, real tag-run attestation verification,
  foreground tracker overlay device walkthroughs, distribution submissions, and
  Android 17 target-SDK gate.
