### P1

- [ ] P1: Decode untrusted file thumbnails in an isolated process
  Why: image, PDF, font, eBook, and archive thumbnails pass attacker-controlled files to decoders inside the permission-bearing app process.
  Evidence: upstream App Manager #2011 maintainer security analysis; Android `<service android:isolatedProcess="true">` documentation; `fm/icons/FmIconFetcher.java`; `fm/icons/FmIcons.java:322-410`; `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
  Touches: a non-exported isolated decoder service and binder contract, `fm/icons/FmIconFetcher.java`, `fm/icons/FmIcons.java`, manifest, malformed-file fixtures, process-death tests.
  Acceptance: thumbnail work receives only duplicated read-only file descriptors plus explicit pixel, byte, and time budgets; the service has no app permissions and cannot open arbitrary paths; malformed input, timeout, OOM, or decoder-process death returns the generic icon without crashing or blocking the file list; API 21 through 23 and a current API are covered.
  Complexity: L

- [ ] P1: Authenticate app-private package-change signals
  Why: internal package and database refresh actions share an exported dynamic receiver with protected system broadcasts, so another app can inject refresh work and package arrays.
  Evidence: `types/PackageChangeReceiver.java:68-89`; `utils/BroadcastUtils.java:12-53`; `main/MainViewModel.java:1089-1120`; Android dynamic-receiver export rules.
  Touches: `types/PackageChangeReceiver.java`, `utils/BroadcastUtils.java`, receiver lifecycle ownership, package-array validation, receiver contract tests.
  Acceptance: system package actions remain receivable, while every `BuildConfig.APPLICATION_ID` action is non-exported or signature-protected; oversized, null, and malformed package arrays are rejected before work is scheduled; an external-app test cannot invoke the private callback; repeated valid signals reuse a bounded executor rather than creating an unbounded thread stream.
  Complexity: S

- [ ] P1: Re-read authoritative App Details state after mutations
  Why: successful privileged cache clears leave stale storage totals, and successful overlay toggles can rebind the cached pre-operation state.
  Evidence: upstream App Manager #2023; `details/info/AppInfoFragment.java:3073-3098`; `details/AppDetailsOverlaysFragment.java:227-232`; `details/struct/AppDetailsOverlayItem.java:73-75`.
  Touches: `details/AppDetailsViewModel.java`, `details/info/AppInfoFragment.java`, `details/AppDetailsOverlaysFragment.java`, overlay and storage state models, tests.
  Acceptance: cache totals reload only after a confirmed successful clear; failure preserves the last confirmed totals; overlay controls are disabled while work is in flight, duplicate taps serialize, and success or failure re-queries `IOverlayManager`; detached completions do not touch views; tests cover both mutation types and failure rollback.
  Complexity: M

- [ ] P1: Enforce user-owned signer policies before installer commit
  Why: AppManagerNG can inspect certificates and detect changes after installation, but it cannot reject an unrecognized signer against a user-approved package policy before a session is committed.
  Evidence: InstallerX 26.05 signer-policy release; Obtainium #2922; AppVerifier; Inure feature matrix; `permission/monitor/SigningCertSnapshotStore.java`; `apk/signing/SignerInfo.java`; `apk/installer/PackageInstallerActivity.java`.
  Touches: schema extension for `SigningCertSnapshotStore`, signer-policy model, installer preflight, App Details certificate actions, snapshot export/import, audit history, tests.
  Acceptance: a user can pin the installed or reviewed SHA-256 signer set for a package; strict policy blocks a fresh install or update before session commit when the candidate signer and valid rotation lineage do not satisfy the pin; the blocked result names both fingerprints and never consults a remote database; changing a pin is a separate reviewed action and is recorded; policies survive restart and snapshot round-trip.
  Complexity: M

- [ ] P1: Classify dependency CVEs by shipped reachability
  Why: the aggregate CVE report mixes packaged runtime, transformed wrappers, host tools, and test dependencies, leaving 962 result rows across 79 artifacts without a reliable shipped-risk boundary.
  Evidence: `build/reports/dependency-check/dependency-check-report.sarif` from 2026-08-22; `scripts/run_dependency_cve_gate.py`; root `build.gradle`; `config/owasp-suppressions.xml`; CVE-2026-11822 and CVE-2026-11824 mappings to AndroidX wrappers and host `sqlite-jdbc`.
  Touches: `scripts/run_dependency_cve_gate.py`, Gradle dependency-report inputs, reproducible-release evidence, SBOM/APK reachability join, SARIF/HTML outputs, suppression validation tests.
  Acceptance: the gate produces separate packaged-release and host/build/test sections for FLOSS and full; every blocking finding records module, configuration, resolved artifact, and APK or SBOM reachability evidence; host-only and CPE-name-collision findings cannot be presented as shipped APK code; CVSS policy still fails closed for reachable findings; stale or blanket suppressions fail validation.
  Complexity: M

- [ ] P1: Bind the privacy policy to the compiled network ledger
  Why: the policy still promises optional Pithus traffic after the integration and its network-ledger entry were removed in v0.6.13.
  Evidence: `PRIVACY_POLICY.rst:21,53,70,121`; `CHANGELOG.md` v0.6.13; `settings/NetworkTransparencyLedger.java`; `settings/NetworkTransparencyLedgerTest.java`. This is the narrow current-network contract, not the broader documentation-truth item parked in `Roadmap_Blocked.md`.
  Touches: `PRIVACY_POLICY.rst`, network-policy contract test, policy build or link check.
  Acceptance: Pithus is absent from current-service definitions, behavior, vendor lists, and references while historical changelog entries remain; a test compares the policy's current optional endpoints with `NetworkTransparencyLedger` and fails when either side adds or removes a service without the other; the policy renders without broken references.
  Complexity: S

### P2

- [ ] P2: Show Disabled, Frozen, and Suspended as text in app rows
  Why: upstream #2006 reports difficulty distinguishing state colors, while the compact V2 row still encodes suspension as `°` and announces only installed or uninstalled state.
  Evidence: `https://github.com/MuntashirAkon/AppManager/issues/2006`; WCAG 2.2 Use of Color; Android accessibility guidance; `main/ApplicationItem.java:323`; `main/MainRecyclerAdapter.java:564`; `res/layout/item_main_v2.xml`.
  Touches: a shared app-state formatter, `main/ApplicationItem.java`, `main/MainRecyclerAdapter.java`, `item_main_v2.xml`, localized strings, accessibility tests.
  Acceptance: every non-normal state renders concise inline text in the metadata row, not a new status pill; the row content description uses the same state; color remains reinforcement only; combined states have deterministic precedence; monochrome, large-text, and TalkBack tests retain package-name readability and row density.
  Complexity: S

- [ ] P2: Support complete regex replacement semantics in Code Editor
  Why: upstream #2022 maps to a local guard that prevents deletion by replacement and leaves other regex behavior without a stable app-owned contract.
  Evidence: `https://github.com/MuntashirAkon/AppManager/issues/2022`; `editor/CodeEditorFragment.java:429-447`; pinned Sora editor 0.24.6 in `versions.gradle`.
  Touches: a small replacement-policy helper, `editor/CodeEditorFragment.java`, editor tests and fixtures.
  Acceptance: replace-current and replace-all accept an empty replacement; numbered capture groups, multiline `^`, zero-width matches, escaped replacement text, and invalid regex errors behave deterministically; invalid patterns do not alter the document; tests pin behavior to the API 21-compatible Sora version.
  Complexity: M

- [ ] P2: Add a backup-destination conformance probe
  Why: network-backed SAF providers can accept selection yet corrupt parallel writes or fail close, reopen, rename, retention, and restore semantics.
  Evidence: Neo Backup #1029 and #1022; Neo Backup FAQ; Android DataBackup 2.0.12 release notes and #485; current capacity, publish, rollback, and pruning paths under `backup/`.
  Touches: backup destination settings, a bounded provider-probe service, per-authority capability store, backup concurrency policy, fake-provider tests.
  Acceptance: a user-initiated health check creates, writes, closes, reopens, checksums, renames, and deletes small probe files, then tests two bounded parallel writes; no user data is read or removed; results persist per URI authority; failed parallel semantics force sequential backup for that destination; unknown capacity is reported as unknown and a failed probe never prunes a known-good backup.
  Complexity: M

- [ ] P2: Bound embedded JADX class decompilation and pin its reachable surface
  Why: the Android JADX fork is fixed at 1.4.7 while upstream has moved, and untrusted DEX or smali can still consume excessive CPU or memory even though resource and export advisories are not reachable through the checked call surface.
  Evidence: `versions.gradle:38`; `dex/DexUtils.java:161-223`; JADX Android fork releases; JADX 1.5.6 release and GHSA-hvp5-5x4f-33fq, GHSA-w6f5-h4x4-rfpj, GHSA-jwv3-q635-w9m4.
  Touches: `dex/DexUtils.java`, a decompile-policy wrapper, worker cancellation, size/time/result ceilings, hostile DEX and smali fixtures, dependency disposition notes.
  Acceptance: class decompilation has explicit input, output, time, and memory ceilings and is cancellable when its host screen closes; malformed, recursive, and oversized fixtures return classified errors without process death; a contract test proves AppManagerNG continues to set `skipResources(true)` and never invokes JADX APK export or GUI paths; reachable upstream fixes are backported or documented against the narrow fork.
  Complexity: M

- [ ] P2: Restore Swift Backup APK plus OBB conversion coverage
  Why: the only APK plus OBB regression test has been commented out since a legacy Robolectric limitation, while the project pins Robolectric 4.16.1 and v0.6.18 changed Swift manifest validation.
  Evidence: `backup/convert/SBConverterTest.java:158-176`; `versions.gradle:64`; `backup/convert/SBConverter.java`; v0.6.18 Swift ZIP-comment validation changelog entry.
  Touches: `SBConverterTest.java`, deterministic Swift fixtures, converter temporary-file cleanup.
  Acceptance: the test runs in the normal unit suite and proves that a valid fixture emits `base.apk` and the expected OBB payload; malformed comment metadata, package mismatch, missing APK, interrupted conversion, and cleanup of temporary output are covered; no live Swift account is required.
  Complexity: S

### P3

- [ ] P3: Show AppOps proxy package and attribution provenance
  Why: App Details displays time, duration, and mode but omits the proxy package and attribution tag available on API 30 and later.
  Evidence: `compat/AppOpsManagerCompat.java:666-700`; `hiddenapi/src/main/java/android/app/AppOpsManagerHidden.java:538-568`; Android `AppOpsManager.OpEventProxyInfo` API.
  Touches: hidden API stubs, `AppOpsManagerCompat`, App Details AppOps model and row, tests.
  Acceptance: API 30 and later show proxy package, UID, and attribution tag when supplied; missing or redacted values render no false provenance; older APIs retain current behavior; parcel and model tests cover direct, proxied, and unavailable events.
  Complexity: M

- [ ] P3: Move remaining module dependency pins into the central ledger
  Why: benchmark and app test configurations duplicate AndroidX Collection and test-runner versions outside the API 21 ceiling policy.
  Evidence: `benchmark/build.gradle:48,51-52`; `app/build.gradle:318-319`; `versions.gradle`; `scripts/verify_dependency_floor.py`.
  Touches: `versions.gradle`, `benchmark/build.gradle`, `app/build.gradle`, `docs/policy/minsdk-21-ceiling.json`, dependency-floor tests and lockfiles.
  Acceptance: each duplicated version is declared once in `versions.gradle`; all modules resolve the same pin; the API 21 ceiling gate covers runtime and test pins that can affect the device floor; dependency locks regenerate without unrelated drift.
  Complexity: S
